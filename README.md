# Three.js
## Examples of code in three.js by using vite

Different code examples are incorporated using the Three.js library and the _VITE_ compilation tool.
We work with **NODE** and **NPM**.
To start the project we do 'npm create vite@latest .'
This will generate a series of base folders and files.
We can delete the src folder, the .json files and the index.html file, replacing them with the files and folders of this repository (We must keep the rest of the folders and files)
